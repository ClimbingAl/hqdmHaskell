Done:   Re-create triples (using collapsed sets) and compare with original set.

Add relations, cardinalities, etc
    - compute/identify the missing relations from the pre-constructed hqdmRelations
        -- Add handling of pureRedeclaredFromRange
H   - compute all relations and their relation-supersubset relationships
H   - test mc datasets to see that they conform to cardinalities
    - calculate the inverse relations
    - perform predicate searches that include inverse relations
    - calculate all allowed relations (based on inheritance, not the sets of all possible relations)
    - introduce the powerset?... probably best to miss this out, but could be useful to think it through

    - Pre-set/compute hqdm patterns:
        - set & parts (inc. specializations of them)
        - temporal parts and their cardinalities (as optional test)
        - activity and association
        - system and component
        - representation_by_sign
        - possible worlds
        - specialization of associations

        Aspire to make this a DSL
